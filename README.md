# Going Google and Facebook free
I'm [going Google and Facebook free](http://sipp.is/going-google-and-facebook-free). It will be a long journey for sure. This repository is for me keeping track of all the things I need to migrate and do.

There's [issue](https://github.com/timiwahalahti/going-google-and-facebook-free/issues) for everything and progress is tracked there.
